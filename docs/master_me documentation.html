audio mastering plugin for live-streaming and podcasting</font></font></p>
<h1 class="western">Introduction</h1>
<p>With the first Covid19 related lockdowns in 2019, many real-life
concerts, conferences and festivals were forced into the digital
domain - and sounded pretty crappy. Having worked for almost 20 years
in audio mastering, Berlin based engineer Klaus Scheuermann started
to develop master_me - a word fusion of <i>automatic mastering</i>
and <i>mini-me</i> - in order to make open source streaming sound
better. After a few weeks of learning and development, master_me was
first used at the 'Quarantine Sessions' - a weekly distributed
electro-accoustic improvised concert, hosted at Stanford's CCRMA
Institute. master_me was developed further to be an easy-to-use tool
for all live streaming applications. In 2022 it was funded by the
Prototype Fund, an open source software funding initiative by the
german ministry of education and research. A stable release is
available since September 2022.</p>
<h1 class="western">Who is master_me for?</h1>
<p>Master_me is for all live streamers.<br/>
It can also be a
valuable tool for podcasters and internet radio stations.</p>
<h1 class="western">What is mastering</h1>
<p>The term 'mastering' usually refers to the last step of sound
manipulation in the audio production process. Historically the vinyl
master was used to duplicate records. Nowadays a digital master is
the file which is being duplicated and distributed to streaming or
download platforms.</p>
<h1 class="western">What is master_me</h1>
<p>Master_me is a multi platform, free and open source audio plug-in
which optimizes sound in live streaming situations. Introducing no
latency, it takes care of master levels and ‘polishes’ the sound
with a chain of effects, closely modeled after the audio chain of
Klaus Scheuermann’s mastering studio in Berlin, Germany.</p>
<p>Although tempting, it is NOT intended to automatically master your
produced music. Your art deserves closer, offline attention.</p>
<h1 class="western">Open Source and licensing</h1>
<p>mater_me is GPL3</p>
<h1 class="western">System requirements and compatibility</h1>
<p>master_me is available in the following formats:</p>
<p>macOS: vst, vst3, lv2</p>
<p>windows: vst, vst3</p>
<p>linux: vst, vst3, lv2, ladspa, jack</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Due to faust and its open architecture, it can possibly be
compiled to a vast variety of target platforms not mentioned above.</p>

<h1 class="western">Installation</h1>
<p>Download here: tba</p>
<p>tba</p>
<h1 class="western">Quickstart</h1>
<p>After Installation, load the plugin on the master channel of your
streaming software or DAW.</p>
<p>Choose a preset and the desired target loudness.</p>
<h1 class="western">Interface</h1>
<h2 class="western">Easy Mode</h2>
<p>The 'easy' mode is a very reduced GUI to make master_me an
easy-to-use tool for all content creators.</p>
<p>Only two choices can be made: choose a preset and set the desired
target loudness</p>
<h2 class="western">Expert Mode</h2>

<h3 class="western">Modules</h3>
<h4 class="western">Module: pre-processing</h4>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘pre-processing’
module contains:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">- a gain-slider to
apply gain to the incoming signal before it hits master_me.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">- a ‘mono’
switch</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">- phase switches for
both left and right channels</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">- ‘stereo-correct’
switch (custom designed process, see tba)</p>
<h4 class="western">Module: gate</h4>
<p>A simple noise gate with the following parameters;</p>
<p>- threshold</p>
<p>- attack</p>
<p>- release</p>
<h4 class="western">Module: leveler</h4>
<p>The leveler is the most critical part of master_me. It will listen
to the incoming signal and adjust it's volume to meet the target
loudness. In order to make this as smooth and natural as possible, a
complex algorithm was designed. The following parameters can be set:</p>
<p>- target loudness: in lufs, a slider also available in 'easy'
mode, next to the input meters on the left). Typical target loudness
values are -18lufs for video streaming, -14lufs for podcasting,
-23lufs for EBU broadcast standard.</p>
<p>- gate threshold: this parameter is used by the leveler to detect
silence. When silence is detected, the leveler 'freezes' and waits
for incoming audio before it continues to adjust the loudness.</p>
<p>- max +: determines the maximum amount of positive gain the
leveler can apply to the incoming signal</p>
<p>- max -: determines the maximum amount of negative gain the
leveler can apply to the incoming signal</p>
<p>- the gate-meter shows silence detection.</p>
<h4 class="western">Module: knee compressor</h4>
<p>The knee compressor is a slow and soft mid-side compression
module. It functions as a subtile, swinging compressor. Typical
equivalents in the analog domain would be a Manley Stereo VARIABLE
MU® compressor or a Vertigo VSC-2. The following parameters can be
set:</p>
<p>- strength: correlating to the ratio of compression. 0% equals a
ratio of 1:1, 100% equals a ratio of 1:infinity</p>
<p>- tar-thresh: offsets the compressors threshold, dependent on the
target loudness.</p>
<p>- attack: compressor's attack time in milliseconds</p>
<p>- release: compressor's release time in milliseconds</p>
<p>- knee: compressor's knee in dB</p>
<p>- link: amount of gain reduction linking between mid and side
channels</p>
<p>- ff-fb: feedforward-feedback determines, where the compressor
receives it's side-chain signal from. feedforward is the input of the
compressor, feedback is the output of the 'brickwall' module.</p>
<p>- make-up: simple gain makeup after compression</p>
<p>- dry-wet: fades between the input signal and the compressed
signal</p>
<p>- the meters show the amount of compression on each channels</p>
<h4 class="western">Module: multiband mid/side compressor</h4>
<p>Being perhaps the most complicated module of master_me, this
module works like this:</p>
<p>The audio is first converted from stereo to mid-side and then
split into 8 frequency bands. The parameters apply to the lowest band
(low) and the highest band (high). For the 6 bands in between, the
parameters are interpolated between 'low' and 'high'.</p>
<p>The parameters for the lowest and highest band are:</p>
<p>- strength: correlating to the ratio of compression. 0% equals a
ratio of 1:1, 100% equals a ratio of 1:infinity</p>
<p>- tar-thresh: offsets the band's threshold, dependent on the
target loudness.</p>
<p>- attack: band's attack time in milliseconds</p>
<p>- release: band's release time in milliseconds</p>
<p>- knee: band's knee in dB</p>
<p>- link: amount of gain reduction linking between mid and side
channels</p>
<p>- crossover: the lowest and highest crossover frequencies can be
set here. All crossovers in between will be interpolated.</p>
<p>- the upper row of meters shows the gain reduction for all eight
mid channels</p>
<p>- the lower row of meters shows the gain reduction for all eight
side channels</p>
<h4 class="western">Module: limiter</h4>
<p>The 'limiter' it is rather a sound-shaping limiter than a clip-
protection limiter. It's equivalents in the analog domain would
typically be a Chandler TG-1 or a UREI 1178. Although the limiter can
apply high compression ratios, it will not prevent from digital
overshoots higher than threshold (which the brickwall module will
take care of). The parameters are:</p>
<p>- strength: correlating to the ratio of compression. 0% equals a
ratio of 1:1, 100% equals a ratio of 1:infinity</p>
<p>- tar-thresh: offsets the limiter's threshold, dependent on the
target loudness.</p>
<p>- attack: limiter's attack time in milliseconds</p>
<p>- release: limiter's release time in milliseconds</p>
<p>- knee: limiter's knee in dB</p>
<p>- ff-fb: feedforward-feedback determines, where the limiter
receives it's side-chain signal from. feedforward is the input of the
limiter, feedback is the output of the limiter.</p>
<p>- make-up: simple gain makeup after limiting.</p>
<p>- gain reduction meter: shows gain reduction applied to the
signal.</p>
<h4 class="western">Module: brickwall</h4>
<p>The 'brickwall' module is the last process in master_me's chain of
modules. It is a fast brickwall limiter which will not allow any
peaks above the desired 'ceiling'. The 'brickwall' process is a
protection limiter and will not sound nice, if it needs to work a
lot.</p>
