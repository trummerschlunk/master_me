    <h1 class="western">Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      With the first Covid19 related lockdowns in 2020, many real-life concerts,
      conferences and festivals were forced into the digital domain - and
      sounded pretty crappy. Having worked for almost 20 years in audio
      mastering, Berlin based engineer Klaus Scheuermann started to develop
      master_me - a word fusion of <i>automatic mastering</i> and
      <i>mini-me</i> - in order to make open source streaming sound better.
      After a few weeks of learning and development, master_me was first used at
      the 'Quarantine Sessions' - a weekly distributed electro-accoustic
      improvised concert, hosted at Stanford's CCRMA Institute. master_me was
      developed further to be an easy-to-use tool for all live streaming
      applications. In 2022 it was funded by the Prototype Fund, an open source
      software funding initiative by the german ministry of education and
      research. A stable release is available since September 2022.
    </p>
    <h1 class="western">Who is master_me for?</h1>
    <p>
      Master_me is for all live streamers.<br />
      It can also be a valuable tool for podcasters and internet radio stations.
    </p>
    <h1 class="western">What is mastering</h1>
    <p>
      The term 'mastering' usually refers to the last step of sound manipulation
      in the audio production process. Historically the vinyl master was used to
      duplicate records. Nowadays a digital master is the file which is being
      duplicated and distributed to streaming or download platforms.
    </p>
    <h1 class="western">What is master_me</h1>
    <p>
      Master_me is a multi platform, free and open source audio plug-in which
      optimizes sound in live streaming situations. Introducing no latency, it
      takes care of master levels and ‘polishes’ the sound with a chain of
      effects, closely modeled after the audio chain of Klaus Scheuermann’s
      mastering studio in Berlin, Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although tempting, it is NOT intended to automatically master your
      produced music. Your art deserves closer, offline attention.
    </p>
    <h1 class="western">Open Source and licensing</h1>
    <p>mater_me is GPL3</p>
    <h1 class="western">System requirements and compatibility</h1>
    <p>master_me is available in the following formats:</p>
    <p>macOS: vst, vst3, lv2</p>
    <p>windows: vst, vst3</p>
    <p>linux: vst, vst3, lv2, ladspa, jack</p>
    <p>
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to faust and its open architecture, it can possibly be compiled to a
      vast variety of target platforms not mentioned above.

      After Installation, load the plugin on the master channel of your
      streaming software or DAW.
    </p>
    <p>Choose a preset.</p>
    <p>Adjust a target-loudness (optional).</p>
    <h1 class="western">Interface</h1>
    <h2 class="western">Easy Mode</h2>
    <p>
      The 'Easy' mode is a very reduced GUI to make master_me an easy-to-use
      tool for all content creators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only two choices can be made: choose a preset and set the desired target
      loudness
    </p>
    <h2 class="western">Expert Mode</h2>
    <h3 class="western">Concept</h3>
    <p>
      The main concept of master_me is the combination of a leveler and a chain
      of dynamics processors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The leveler can be seen as a big volume knob which you would grab, when
      the sound is too low or too high for your taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following chain is designed to result in a natural, balanced and
      consistent sound if it is hit at the right level (-&gt;leveler). It will
      take care of peaks in the audio, like short loud noises and balance the
      frequency spectrum.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some additional modules before the leveler for your convenience.
    </p>

    <h3 class="western">Modules</h3>
    <h4 class="western">Module: pre-processing</h4>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
      The ‘pre-processing’ module contains:
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
      - a gain-slider to apply gain to the incoming signal before it hits
      master_me.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">- a ‘mono’ switch</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
      - phase switches for both left and right channels
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
      - ‘stereo-correct’ switch (custom designed process, see 'stereo-correct')
    </p>
    <h4 class="western">Module: gate</h4>
    <p>A simple noise gate with the following parameters:</p>
    <p>- threshold</p>
    <p>- attack</p>
    <p>- release</p>
    <h4 class="western">Module: EQ</h4>
    <p>
      The EQ offers some simple tools for frequency spectrum manipulation. The
      parameters are:
    </p>
    <p>- highpass frequency: the cutoff frequency of a soft highpass filter</p>
    <p>
      - tilt-gain: gain of a 'tilt' equalizer, which will bend the frequency
      spectrum either to the higher frequencies or the lower frequencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      - side-eq gain: gain parameter of the 'side-eq' which boosts a certain
      frequency range in the side signal in order to make the sound 'wider'.
    </p>
    <p>- side-eq frequency: center frequency of the side-eq</p>
    <p>- side-eq bandwidth: width of the side-eq</p>
    <h4 class="western">Module: leveler</h4>
    <p>
      The leveler is the most critical part of master_me. It will listen to the
      incoming signal and adjust it's volume to meet the target loudness. In
      order to make this as smooth and natural as possible, a complex algorithm
      was designed. The following parameters can be set:
    </p>
    <p>
      - target loudness: in lufs, a slider also available in 'easy' mode, next
      to the input meters on the left). Typical target loudness values are
      -18lufs for video streaming, -14lufs for podcasting, -23lufs for EBU
      broadcast standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      - brake threshold: this parameter is used by the leveler to detect
      silence. When silence is detected, the leveler 'freezes' and waits for
      incoming audio before it continues to adjust the loudness.
    </p>
    <p>
      - max +: determines the maximum amount of positive gain the leveler can
      apply to the incoming signal
    </p>
    <p>
      - max -: determines the maximum amount of negative gain the leveler can
      apply to the incoming signal
    </p>
    <p>- the brake-meter shows silence detection.</p>
    <h4 class="western">Module: knee compressor</h4>
    <p>
      The knee compressor is a slow and soft mid-side compression module. It
      functions as a subtile, swinging compressor. Typical equivalents in the
      analog domain would be a Manley Stereo VARIABLE MU® compressor or a
      Vertigo VSC-2. The following parameters can be set:
    </p>
    <p>
      - strength: correlating to the ratio of compression. 0% equals a ratio of
      1:1, 100% equals a ratio of 1:infinity
    </p>
    <p>
      - tar-thresh: offsets the compressors threshold, dependent on the target
      loudness.
    </p>
    <p>- attack: compressor's attack time in milliseconds</p>
    <p>- release: compressor's release time in milliseconds</p>
    <p>- knee: compressor's knee in dB</p>
    <p>
      - link: amount of gain reduction linking between mid and side channels
    </p>
    <p>
      - ff-fb: feedforward-feedback determines, where the compressor receives
      it's side-chain signal from. feedforward is the input of the compressor,
      feedback is the output of the 'brickwall' module.
    </p>
    <p>- make-up: simple gain makeup after compression</p>
    <p>- dry-wet: fades between the input signal and the compressed signal</p>
    <p>- the meters show the amount of compression on each channels</p>
    <h4 class="western">Module: multiband mid/side compressor</h4>
    <p>
      Being perhaps the most complicated module of master_me, this module works
      like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      The audio is first converted from stereo to mid-side and then split into 8
      frequency bands. The parameters apply to the lowest band (low) and the
      highest band (high). For the 6 bands in between, the parameters are
      interpolated between 'low' and 'high'.
    </p>
    <p>The parameters for the lowest and highest band are:</p>
    <p>
      - strength: correlating to the ratio of compression. 0% equals a ratio of
      1:1, 100% equals a ratio of 1:infinity
    </p>
    <p>
      - tar-thresh: offsets the band's threshold, dependent on the target
      loudness.
    </p>
    <p>- attack: band's attack time in milliseconds</p>
    <p>- release: band's release time in milliseconds</p>
    <p>- knee: band's knee in dB</p>
    <p>
      - link: amount of gain reduction linking between mid and side channels
    </p>
    <p>
      - crossover: the lowest and highest crossover frequencies can be set here.
      All crossovers in between will be interpolated.
    </p>
    <p>
      - the upper row of meters shows the gain reduction for all eight mid
      channels
    </p>
    <p>
      - the lower row of meters shows the gain reduction for all eight side
      channels
    </p>
    <h4 class="western">Module: limiter</h4>
    <p>
      The 'limiter' it is rather a sound-shaping limiter than a clip- protection
      limiter. It's equivalents in the analog domain would typically be a
      Chandler TG-1 or a UREI 1178. Although the limiter can apply high
      compression ratios, it will not prevent from digital overshoots higher
      than threshold (which the brickwall module will take care of). The
      parameters are:
    </p>
    <p>
      - strength: correlating to the ratio of compression. 0% equals a ratio of
      1:1, 100% equals a ratio of 1:infinity
    </p>
    <p>
      - tar-thresh: offsets the limiter's threshold, dependent on the target
      loudness.
    </p>
    <p>- attack: limiter's attack time in milliseconds</p>
    <p>- release: limiter's release time in milliseconds</p>
    <p>- knee: limiter's knee in dB</p>
    <p>
      - ff-fb: feedforward-feedback determines, where the limiter receives it's
      side-chain signal from. feedforward is the input of the limiter, feedback
      is the output of the limiter.
    </p>
    <p>- make-up: simple gain makeup after limiting.</p>
    <p>- gain reduction meter: shows gain reduction applied to the signal.</p>
    <h4 class="western">Module: brickwall</h4>
    <p>
      The 'brickwall' module is the last process in master_me's chain of
      modules. It is a fast brickwall limiter which will not allow any peaks
      above the desired 'ceiling'. The 'brickwall' process is a protection
      limiter and will not sound nice, if it needs to work a lot.
